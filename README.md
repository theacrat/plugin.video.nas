# NAS - Not a Stremio

Use your Stremio setup on Kodi.

This addon pulls your library, catalogs, streams, and more from your Stremio account.

## Installation

As of now, you don't (unless you know how to install from source).

Once it's in a more acceptable state (e.g. caching as to not hammer Stremio's servers), I will make a proper release and install guide.

## Features

I will **NOT** add features that are not in Stremio. The whole point is keeping it simple by only reaching feature parity. If you need something more advanced, use one of the plethora of other addons.
