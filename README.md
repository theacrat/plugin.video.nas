# NAS - Not a Stremio

Use your Stremio setup on Kodi.

This addon pulls your library, catalogs, streams, and more from your Stremio account.

## Installation

Doesn't work on Windows or Xbox, sorry. Hopefully they bump the Python version for Kodi 22.

Download the ZIP file from releases. I may set up a repository eventually (if anyone actually uses this).

## Features

I will **NOT** add features that are not in Stremio. The whole point is keeping it simple ~~by only reaching feature parity~~. If you need something more advanced, use one of the plethora of other addons.

I've decided that I actually don't care about adding the unchecked features below. Kodi is either not a great platform for implementing them (e.g. subtitles - the system works entirely differently, making it hard to automate adding subs), or has a better, more native way of accessing them (e.g. live TV). The current feature set should cover the majority of users.
